# Axios HTTP Requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

This repo contains examples showing how to use **Axios** in JavaScript for making HTTP requests â€”  
`GET`, `POST`.

Axios is a promise-based HTTP client that works in both **browser** and **Node.js**,  
and is often simpler and more powerful than using `fetch()` directly.
